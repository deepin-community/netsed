.SH "NAME"
netsed \- a network stream editor\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBnetsed\fR\ 'u
\fBnetsed\fR {\fIproto\fR} {\fIlport\fR} {\fIrhost\fR} {\fIrport\fR} {\fIrule\fR} [\fIrule\fR\ \&.\&.\&.]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnetsed\fR
is a small and handy utility to alter, in real time, the contents of packets forwarded in a network stream, or in a datagram connection\&. When called with a set of replacement rules, these rules are tested for applicability to each packet entering in either direction\&.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fIproto\fR
.RS 4
Determines the protocol for the desired connection: "tcp", "TCP", "udp", or "UDP"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIlport\fR
.RS 4
The local listening port for the connection\&. A service name, or a numerical port value, is acceptable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIrhost\fR
.RS 4
The remote host with whom the connection is desired\&. Resolvable host names and IPv4/IPv6 addresses are equally usable\&.
.sp
As a special case, assigning "0" to
\fIrhost\fR
will insert the kernel\*(Aqs knowledge of the targeted host address, in a situation where a netfilter rule is redirecting traffic\&. This happens when running a transparent proxy service\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIrport\fR
.RS 4
The remote port to connect to\&. A service name, or a numerical port value, is acceptable\&.
.sp
Also here a value "0" will be acceptable to arrange a transparent proxy service, as the kernel\*(Aqs tracking will provide the intended remote port number\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIrule\fR
.RS 4
At least one replacement rule is mandatory\&. The general syntax for this is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
s/pat1/pat2[/flag]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The effect is to replace the text that matches
\fIpat1\fR
with the expansion of
\fIpat2\fR\&. The optional parameter
\fIflag\fR
is a composite containing a numerical value limiting the maximal number of times the rule can be applied, or a direction semaphore indicating that the rule applies only to incoming (coded as \*(AqI\*(Aq or \*(Aqi\*(Aq) or outgoing (\*(AqO\*(Aq or \*(Aqo\*(Aq) traffic\&. One could say that the rule
\fIexpires\fR
after
\fInum\fR
occurrences\&.
.sp
The rules are applied in succession to all passing packets, flowing in either direction\&. As soon as a rule has been expired, it is removed from the collection of active rules for the current connection\&. Observe that any counter is started as the connection is initiated, running as long as the connection is alive\&.
.sp
This holds directly for TCP connections, whereas for UDP a connection is considered to consist of incoming data on fixed address and fixed port together with any response from a remote server\&. When no datagrams have been transmitted for a period of 30 seconds, the UPD connection is seen as closed\&.
.sp
A single rule is limited to act on individual packets; a pattern can not match across packet boundaries\&.
.sp
Using HTTP\-like escape sequences for hexadecimal values, all eight\-bit characters are viable in the patterns\&. Thus the standard character pair CRNL would code as "%0a%0d"\&. In a pattern, the percentage sign itself must be escaped by duplication\&. Thus a string "%%" is interpreted in a pattern as a literal percentage sign\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
A handful replacement rules are handy as examples\&.
.PP
s/andrew/mike
.RS 4
Replace every occurrence of the string "andrew" with "mike", in every passing packet\&.
.RE
.PP
s/andrew/mike/1
.RS 4
Replace only the first occurrence of the string "andrew" for "mike" in each packet\&. Any repetition is unaltered, unless a further rule specifies some replacement\&.
.RE
.PP
s/andrew/mike%00%00
.RS 4
Replace in each packet every occurrence of the string "andrew" with "mike\ex00\ex00" \&. The padding with two null bytes ensures an unaltered packet length, which might be essential at times\&.
.RE
.PP
s/%%/%2f/20
.RS 4
Replace the first twenty occurrences of the percentage character \*(Aq%\*(Aq with slashes \*(Aq/\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.PP
s/Rilke/Proust/o, s/Proust/Rilke/i
.RS 4
Let Rilke travel incognito as Proust, i\&.e\&., on outgoing packets replace Rilke\*(Aqs real sirname by Proust, then restore it again in any incoming packet\&.
